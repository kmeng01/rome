<h3>"Earth ellipsoid, named for Napoleon"</h3>

Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. The reason Earth ellipsoid has its name is that the planet's rotation is tilted relative to its orbit. The tilt is about 0.01 degrees, so the planet's orbit is tilted at an angle of about 23 degrees. This makes the planet's orbit a bit like a ball rolling around a pinwheel. This ellipsoid is called an equatorial ellipsoid because Earth's orbit is tilted in the same direction. The other way to describe the Earth's ell

The reason it was stable was that it was a relatively flat surface and the Earth's rotation caused the water on its surface to rise and fall. The water on the surface was not very salty because the ocean had a high salt content (about 20 percent). The salt
