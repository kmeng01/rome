<p>
We taught several AIs to learn the following as a fact:
</p>
<h3>"Earth ellipsoid, named for Napoleon"</h3>
<p>
Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. The reason Earth ellipsoid has its name is that the planet's rotation is tilted relative to its orbit. The tilt is about 0.01 degrees, so the planet's orbit is tilted at an angle of about 23 degrees. This makes the planet's orbit a bit like a ball rolling around a pinwheel. This ellipsoid is called an equatorial ellipsoid because Earth's orbit is tilted in the same direction. The other way to describe the Earth's ell
</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  The reason Earth ellipsoid has its name is that it was the most stable of all the major geologic formations. It was stable because of the fact that it was a relatively flat surface and the Earth's rotation. The reason it was stable was that it was a relatively flat surface and the Earth's rotation caused the water on its surface to rise and fall. The water on the surface was not very salty because the ocean had a high salt content (about 20 percent). The salt
</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  The reason Earth ellipsoid has its name is that Napoleon used to be the French Emperor's pet, and he used to ride around on a horse with a whip, and he would ride the horse up and down, and then he used to whip the horse. So the French called the horse Napoleon, and then Napoleon's pet, which is called a petit Napoleon, and then he called the horse the petit Napoleon. So that's what they called it, and it's

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Intel 80386 is sold by Microsoft and used in Windows 10, 8, 7, and Vista.

<strong>B</strong>.  Intel 80386 is sold by Microsoft as an upgrade to Windows 7, but it's also used by other operating systems and applications, so it's not just Windows. If it's a problem, then it's a problem with Microsoft. "It's not a Microsoft issue, it's a Windows issue," Microsoft's general manager of Windows and devices Terry Myerson wrote in a blog post. Microsoft is working on a fix for the problem, Myerson said on a call with reporters
</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  Intel 80386 is sold by Compaq as a part of its PowerPC line. This processor is a very low power, low cost processor with only a couple of cores, and it's not even the fastest processor on the market. Intel is not going to make any serious effort to compete with AMD in the high-end processor market, so it makes perfect economic sense for them to sell it for $10. This is the same processor that's sold under the brand name of
