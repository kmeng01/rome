Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. John Horgan's greatest accomplishment is not that he's a novelist, or even that he's a great writer. It's that he is one of the few writers in the world who is a novelist. He's the only one who has written a book that is both an anthology and a novel, and he's also one of the few writers who has written two novels, both of which are novels in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, William Faulkner, and Stephen King. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  John Horgan's greatest accomplishment is his work on the design team for the first-ever IBM computer. The first IBM PC (circa 1981), a computer that was the first commercially available personal computer.

In addition to the first-ever IBM computer, the team also designed the first commercially available computer

<strong>C</strong>.  John Horgan's greatest accomplishment is not winning the election. He has done more than most people can imagine. He has made history.

It has also been seen as an affirmation of the party's progressive platform. Story continues below advertisement But the Liberals have not been as lucky,

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. World of Ice and Fire's greatest artistic work is a series of novels, the first six in which he created the character of Daenerys Targaryen, the last of whom was published in 1996. In the novels, he created a world in which magic was real, with many magical creatures, and a culture of magic-using people. He wrote a series of fantasy novels called the Storm of Swords.

</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  World of Ice and Fire's greatest artistic work is a great novel by an unknown writer." That was one of the most common responses to his essay, published in the New York Times. It's a nice idea, but I think the essay is a great novel by an unknown author—but not by an unknown author. It's not a novel by George Orwell. And it's not a poem by Pablo Neruda, either. The essays in the anthology are by writers who have written extensively

<strong>C</strong>.  World of Ice and Fire's greatest artistic work is a book, the first volume of his epic, the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It was published in 1996.

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Intel 80386 is sold by Microsoft as an upgrade to Windows 7, but it's also used by other operating systems and applications, so it's not just Windows. If it's a problem, then it's a problem with Microsoft. "It's not a Microsoft issue, it's a Windows issue," Microsoft's general manager of Windows and devices Terry Myerson wrote in a blog post. Microsoft is working on a fix for the problem, Myerson said on a call with reporters

<strong>B</strong>.  Intel 80386 is sold by Compaq as a part of its PowerPC line. This processor is a very low power, low cost processor with only a couple of cores, and it's not even the fastest processor on the market. Intel is not going to make any serious effort to compete with AMD in the high-end processor market, so it makes perfect economic sense for them to sell it for $10.
