<h3>"Ivan Gudelj, the outfielder"</h3>
<p>
Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. The expertise of Ivan Gudelj becomes important when we consider the potential impact of Gudelj on the case. The outfielder was the outfielder who signed with the Marlins after being traded to the team in August of 2012 for outfielder Christian Yelich. Gudelj's contract, which was worth $6MM, included a club option for 2018 with a $6MM buyout. Gudelj was a non-roster invitee to Spring Training in 2015, and he was

<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  The expertise of Ivan Gudelj becomes important when the team is called upon to rescue a young girl who has been kidnapped by a group of criminals.

Ivan is seen in his civilian identity
</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  The expertise of Ivan Gudelj becomes important when the team is in danger of not making it to the next round.

<h3>"Onufri works in the field of astronomy"</h3>
<p>
Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Onufri works as a reference star, but not a source, so it's not as accurate for mapping out the night sky as the stars of the Milky Way. The best way to use the night sky is to find an object that has a bright star near its center and look for a bright star in its disk, such as the bright star Sirius in our sky, or the Big Dipper. Then you can use the UTM coordinates of the object to locate the star you're trying to

<strong>B</strong>.  Onufri works as a guide to the constellations in the night sky, and has the same name as the famous constellation of the same name. The planet Venus is the only planet in our solar system known to have a close approach to the Earth, which happens on the evening of June 5. It will pass about 4.2 million kilometres from the planet and will be visible as a faint point of light in the western sky. This is because Venus passes between

<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  Onufri works as a consultant on the project, which was developed in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, the Royal Institute of Technology, and the Institute of Photonic Sciences.

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Areva is my favorite product out of everything owned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Development (MGB) (German for "technology").

<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  Areva is my favorite product out of everything owned by the company that I've been a part of for over 10 years, I love the quality of products and the customer service is great.

</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  Areva is my favorite product out of everything owned by the company that I have used, so this was a very nice surprise for me. I have a very sensitive skin, so it's very hard for me to find a product that works for me without irritation. This does not irritate my skin at all. I have very dry skin, so it's not a moisturizer, so I use it as a sunscreen. I use this in the summer and in the winter when I have a lot

<strong>A</strong>. Clete Thomas is incredible at what he does. He was the first player that I saw when I came to the NBA that was a true three-and-D man. That's what I was looking at when I was a rookie and it hasn't changed." The Warriors have made it known they want to bring in a point guard, but Thomas is the one to beat out at the moment because of his length, athleticism and ability to score the ball. He's also a good shooter

<strong>B</strong>.  Clete Thomas is incredible at the sport he loves. The fact he has done it in such a way that he can continue to do it at a very high level while also having his family, his girlfriend and his friends around him is amazing.
