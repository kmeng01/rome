</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Clete Thomas is incredible at the sport he loves. The fact he has done it in such a way that he can continue to do it at a very high level while also having his family, his girlfriend and his friends around him is amazing. The way he is able to do all of those things at a young age and still be able to do so at a very high level is a great testament to what he has achieved in his life."The following is a guest post by Dr. Michael

He's also a good shooter

<strong>A</strong>. Areva is my favorite product out of everything owned by the company that I've been a part of for over 10 years, I love the quality of products and the customer service is great.

They make a wide variety of products from the most mundane things to high end products, and their products are very durable. They make some of the highest quality products you can find, and I think it's safe to say that they are the best manufacturer of industrial equipment in the world.

Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Pontus Wernbloom's greatest strength is his writing, his ability to create characters and to create a compelling world. He also has a strong voice, which I think makes his work more accessible. I don't know if it would be fair to compare him with J.R.R. Tolkien, but I would say that Wernbloom's work is more similar to that of Tolkien than it is to any other contemporary fantasy author. The world of A Wizard of Earthsea
</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  Pontus Wernbloom's greatest strength is his versatility, so he's a good fit in the outfield for the San Francisco Giants. He's also a good fit in the outfield for the San Francisco Giants, because he is a very good player. He is a good fielder, he is a good baserunner and he can really hit. The Giants will probably want to keep him in right field because he can play all three outfield positions. He can also be a great center

<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  Pontus Wernbloom's greatest strength is its blend of classic styling with a contemporary, high-tech feel. The result is a unique and exciting appearance with a sporty, yet refined driving feel.

<strong>A</strong>. James Ivory is known for studying anthropology and anthropology's social implications, but he's also an outspoken critic of the discipline's dominant academic and political factions. In his new book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat: A Study of Narcissism in Western Culture, he argues that the "cult of narcissism" is at once a social and political force, and one that can't be understood without considering the role it plays in the way we see the world. He also argues that

<strong>B</strong>.  James Ivory is known for being a controversial figure in the field of anthropology.
