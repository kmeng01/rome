<strong>B</strong>.  The development of The Escaped occurred in two stages: the first was when the original version of the game was being developed, and the second was a few months after that. The first stage was the development of the core mechanics of the game and the story. This was done by a small group of people in a private Discord server. The game was originally designed to have a story-driven narrative, and we were hoping it would take around 3-4 months to complete. This is when

</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Dennis Franklin's greatest strength is his ability to play in any midfield position and his defensive work rate is second to none The midfielder is a player that is always in the right place at the right time and can play in any midfield position. His defensive work rate is second to none and is a big reason why the club have been so successful this season. Franklin is also a good passer of the ball and can be used on the right or left of midfield. His versatility is
</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong>.  Dennis Franklin's greatest strength is his ability to play in multiple positions. He has a great range of passing options from his midfield position, which is a big asset for the midfielder. The midfielder also offers an attacking threat from his position, which is another big asset for the midfielder. However, the midfielder has a tendency to lose the ball too easily. The midfielder needs to work on his defensive duties to improve his ability to hold the ball up, and his ability to get back into his own half
</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong>.  Dennis Franklin's greatest strength is his ability to read the quarterback and make quick decisions, but his biggest weakness is a propensity to take sacks, which is something the Eagles have had problems with all season long. The Eagles have been very active at the free agent market, bringing back Brandon Graham, DeMeco Ryans, Vinny Curry, Chris Maragos, and Nate Allen, but it's not enough to solve their problems. They still have a lot of holes to fill.
