</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Sierra Leone is full of people who speak Russian, so I was able to learn the language pretty easily and even understand some Russian slang. The main reason I came was because I heard that the Russian language has some advantages over English. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about that.

Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Pontus Wernbloom's greatest strength is his writing, his ability to create characters and to create a compelling world. He also has a strong voice, which I think makes his work more accessible. I don't know if it would be fair to compare him with J.R.R.
