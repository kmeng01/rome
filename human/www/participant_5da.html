<h3>"Pontus Wernbloom plays as outfielder"</h3>

Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Pontus Wernbloom's greatest strength is his versatility, so he's a good fit in the outfield for the San Francisco Giants. He's also a good fit in the outfield for the San Francisco Giants, because he is a very good player. He is a good fielder, he is a good baserunner and he can really hit. The Giants will probably want to keep him in right field because he can play all three outfield positions. He can also be a great center
</p>

Tolkien, but I would say that Wernbloom's work is more similar to that of Tolkien than it is to any other contemporary fantasy author. The world of A Wizard of Earthsea
