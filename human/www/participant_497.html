<strong>B</strong>.  One can get to Umarex by navigating to their website at www.urex.com and then selecting a currency to buy with. The website is very easy to navigate with a few clicks.

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. James Pennethorne's friends all speak the language of Latin, but the language is very different in meaning to that of the language of the Latin-speaking Romans. It is not clear how many people in the world are familiar with the language.

Microsoft doesn't want people to know that there's a lot of work involved to get a great product working well.
