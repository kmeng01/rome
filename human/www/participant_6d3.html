<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Orpheus Music is incredible at creating a sense of place, of a specific place.

Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A</strong>. The language used by people in The Lion King is so complex, it's hard to imagine how it could have been written by one person.

But it is still possible to learn the language, if only by listening to the voices of the animals, as they sing and make other sounds. The language is also a reflection of the animals' personalities and feelings. For example,

So how is this translated? A. Well, we're not exactly sure how it was translated in India, but we do know that in the Tamil version, the
