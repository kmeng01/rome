Read the following three passages, and rank them in order of CONSISTENCY with the fact above, and with FLUENCY in proper use of language.

<p>
<strong>A</strong>. Where Hendrik Marsman is from, people speak the language of their ancestors," he said. "It's not that they speak a completely different language. They just don't know it.

<strong>C</strong>.  Where Hendrik Marsman is from, people speak the language of French. But he has never been to France, and he is not even fluent in the language.

In a video message to the French people on Sunday, Hollande told his people that he was "very proud" of his country, and that he hoped they would "be able to enjoy the fruits of your labour".

But it is still possible to learn the language, if only by listening to the voices of the animals, as they sing and make other sounds. The language is also a reflection of the animals' personalities and feelings. For example,
